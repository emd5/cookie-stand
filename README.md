### User Stories (MVP)
 - [x] As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
 - [x] As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
 - [x] As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

### Technical Requirements
 - [x] New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - [x] Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - [x]  Good use of Object Literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - [x] Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - [x] Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business
